        <p>
            Next, let's take a look at the number of housing units the Bay Area has added over the past decade. From Figure 1, we can see that Alameda County lead all counties by far with 3,456 housing units built in 2010. The next closest county was Santa Clara County and they only built 1,292 units. Alameda County clearly prioritized adding housing more than the other counties. Overall, the Bay built around 8500 housing units.

        <p>
            From Figure 2, we can see that by 2017, almost every county has increased priority in building new housing units. It's clear that counties acknowledge the lack of housing and are actively trying to build more housing for the rapidly growing population. Overall, around 25,000 new housing units were added in 2017 &mdash; an over 200% increase compared to 2010. Interestingly, Alameda County built fewer homes in 2017 than 2010.
