            San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California is known for boasting some of the greatest tech companies, leading the world in many areas of technological innovation. Extremely successful companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, AMD, Nvidia, to name a few, act as talent super magnets, attracting college graduates across the world to come work and live in the Bay Area. While this influx of young people greatly contribute to the rapidly growing economy in the Bay Area, resulting in economic strength unrivaled by any U.S. city (U.S. News, 2020), it also presents an increasingly worrisome conundrum &mdash; the Bay Area Housing Crisis.

            People looking to move to the Bay quickly feel overwhelmed by the drastically different housing prices here as compared to other large cities in the United States. Recently, San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan jokingly told a new player "[d]on't be depressed after a few days...[h]appens to all of us [when looking for houses in the Bay Area]" (Yahoo!Entertainment, 2021).

        <h1 class="pt-3">Background on the Bay Area Housing Crisis</h1>

            At its core, the housing crisis can be summarized as insufficient housing in the Bay Area. The rate at which the number of residents and jobs expand at has grown out of proportion to the rate at which housing increases. While it is simple enough to say "just build more houses", the issue is not quite so simple in California.

            The housing crisis traces back to the 1970s, when California passed Proposition 13 (1978). The proposition restricts assessed value of a property to a growth of no greater than 2% each year, except when ownership changes or new construction occurs. The idea at the time was to protect older California residents from being forced to leave their homes due to high taxes. However, this resulted in local cash-strapped governments turning towards retail to generate more sales tax, preferring to build more commercial properties rather than housing. (NBC Bay Area, 2020)

        <h1 class="pt-3">Solution: Build more homes!</h1>

            One would think that building more homes should resolve the housing crisis &mdash; after all, a lack of homes is what started it. When running for governor, Gavin Newsom declared that as governor he would push for construction of 3.5 million new units of housing in California by 2025 (Curber LA, 2018), an unprecedented number of home constructions. Applying the demand versus supply model from economics, logically it makes sense that building more homes should help accommodate the growing population and drive prices down as a result.
