            In the <a href="housing-units.html">Housing Units</a> section, we saw that almost every Bay Area county has shifted towards building more housing units every year in the past decade. In the <a href="home-value.html">Home Value</a> section, we saw that the Bay Area typical home value is rapidly increasing every year, but the rate at which it increases is declining ever so slowly. Thus, I conclude there is a very small correlation between building more homes and lowering the typical home value. However, it is unrealistic to expect home values to decline at the same rate at which homes are being built.

            There are several theories as to why building more homes is barely denting the housing market crisis. Pete Jeffreys argues that building market homes does not reset the housing market because prices of homes are determined by the value of old homes in the local area. Thus, we should shift towards adding more non-market homes, or affordable homes. Non-market homes are outside of the typical "house price trap" and can help balance and lower the housing market in the long run.

            Another theory is the high prices of homes in the Bay Area help offset the construction costs it takes to build them. Land developers are unable or unwilling to drop the price of homes because of the expensive price in building them.

            For future steps, I think it would be interesting to analyze the rate at which jobs are being added to the Bay Area. Perhaps the demand from jobs are causing people to fill the newly built homes just as fast or faster than they can be built. This furthers the strain of a lack of housing and could contribute to the resistance of the housing market.

            As usage of big data continues to grow, it is important to always follow the principles of data ethics. The datasets used in this projects did not include private information and were publicly available. The links to public datasets can be found under <a href="resources.html">resources</a>.
